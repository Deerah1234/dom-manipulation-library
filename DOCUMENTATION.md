## updateState Usage

To update the state of the store, use the `updateState()` function. For example, to update the title property of the store to 'My New Title', you would use the following code:

```javascript
updateState('title', 'My New Title');
```

To retrieve a property from the store, simply access the property on the store object. For example, to retrieve the title property of the store, you would use the following code:

```javascript
const title = store.title;
```
